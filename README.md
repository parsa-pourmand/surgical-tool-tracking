# surgical-tool-tracking
This project showcases a real-time 3D tracking system for surgical tools using computer vision techniques. The system employs a monocular webcam, a set of ArUco markers, and a custom 3D-printed tool mount to estimate the precise position and orientation of a surgical instrument's tip with millimetric accuracy.
